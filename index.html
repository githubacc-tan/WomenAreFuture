                <h4>Statistics show women are <i>severly</i> underepresented in tech</h4>
                <p>STEM jobs are still majorly underrepresented by women, only About a Quarter of STEM Workers Are Female. And, on average, the STEM degrees that women are more likely to pursue are more science-oriented over engineering, math or computers, and tend to be lower paid.  </p>
                <p>Stereotypes and educational differences can lead to the decline of women in STEM fields. These differences start as early as the third grade according to Thomas Dee, with boys advancing in math and science and girls advancing in reading. However, with your help and support that changes now

            <h4>STEM Gender discrimination</h4>
            <p>According to a poll taken in the US, more than 4,900 workers in the U.S., found that in the traditionally male-dominated fields of science, technology, engineering and math (STEM), only 19 percent of men said they had experienced gender discrimination at work, versus 50 percent of women.</p>

        <h4>Prominent fighters, inspiring women</h4>
        <p>On June 16, 1963, Valentina Tereshkova was the first woman to go to space, fighting for women's rights to participate in STEM. Sally Ride was part of a 35 person team traveling on the Space Challenger Shuttle in 1983. Throughout her life she shot down common misconceptions about women in stem</p>
        <p>She insriped young girls to explore their passions in science, tech, engineering, and math to promote STEM literacy. She has received numerous honors and awards including being apart of the Women's Hall of Fame. Her legacy lives on, and continues to inspire women till this day.</p>

<ul>
  <h5> Speak up, gain your recogonition </h5>
  <li>A report showed that 82% of women had their stem ideas ignored in the workplace or they did not recieve credit for their idea. Don't be afraid to claim your credit!</li>
  <h5>Invest in peer networks</h5>
  <li>Attend events that allow you to connect with other women in STEM, most successful women in stem are aware of how to develop strong and meaningful peer networks with others.  </li>
  <h5>Have Confidence</h5>
  <li>  Confidence is KEY. Girls are just as capable as boys when given encouragement and educational opportunities. Furthermore, lets begin to work to emphasize strong and visible role models of women and women of color in math and science fields.
